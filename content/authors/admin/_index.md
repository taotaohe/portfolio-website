I'm a Post-doctoral researcher of cognitive neuroscience in Prof. [Fang Fang](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/kxyj/kysys/238242.htm)'s lab, Peking University. I received my Ph.D. from the [Predictive Brain Lab](https://www.predictivebrainlab.com/) at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, the Netherlands, where I worked with Prof. [Floris P. de Lange](https://www.predictivebrainlab.com/people-details/floris-de-lange/) and studied prediction. 

My research interests is trying to understand how our perception are modulated by prior knowledge and expectations, and how these in turn influence our behaviour. To address these questions, I use fMRI, MEG, Computational modelling, Eye-tracking and Psychophysics.
