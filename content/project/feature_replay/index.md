Humans are adept at making inferences by integrating past experiences or knowledge of how things relate to each other. In spatial tasks, cells, including place and grid cells, spontaneously recapitulate old and explore new spatial trajectories — a phenomenon known as ‘replay’. In our recent studies, we explored whether feature information involved in replay.

Our preliminary results showed that feature information indeed involved in replay. Importantly, our brain replays these feature information in an reversed order and temporally compressed pattern.
