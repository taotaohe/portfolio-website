 abstract = {It has been suggested that our visual system does not only process stimuli that are directly available to our eyes, but also has a role in maintaining information in VWM over a period of seconds. It remains unclear however what happens to VWM representations in the visual system when we make saccades. Here, we tested the hypothesis that VWM representations are remapped within the visual system after making saccades. We directly compared the content of VWM for saccade and no-saccade conditions using MVPA of delay-related activity measured with fMRI. We found that when participants did not make a saccade, VWM representations were robustly present in contralateral early visual cortex. When making a saccade, VWM representations degraded in contralateral V1-V3 after the saccade shifted the location of the remembered grating to the opposite visual field. However, contrary to our hypothesis we found no evidence for the representations of the remembered grating at the saccadic target location in the opposite visual field, suggesting that there is no evidence for remapping of VWM in early visual cortex. Interestingly, IPS showed persistent VWM representations in both the saccade and no-saccade condition. Together, our results indicate that VWM representations in early visual cortex are not remapped across eye movements, potentially limiting the role of early visual cortex in VWM storage.
