abstract: It has been suggested that our visual system does not only process stimuli
  that are directly available to our eyes, but also has a role in maintaining information
  in VWM over a period of seconds. It remains unclear however what happens to VWM
  representations in the visual system when we make saccades. Here, we tested the
  hypothesis that VWM representations are remapped within the visual system after
  making saccades. We directly compared the content of VWM for saccade and no-saccade
  conditions using MVPA of delay-related activity measured with fMRI. We found that
  when participants did not make a saccade, VWM representations were robustly present
  in contralateral early visual cortex. When making a saccade, VWM representations
  degraded in contralateral V1-V3 after the saccade shifted the location of the remembered
  grating to the opposite visual field. However, contrary to our hypothesis we found
  no evidence for the representations of the remembered grating at the saccadic target
  location in the opposite visual field, suggesting that there is no evidence for
  remapping of VWM in early visual cortex. Interestingly, IPS showed persistent VWM
  representations in both the saccade and no-saccade condition. Together, our results
  indicate that VWM representations in early visual cortex are not remapped across
  eye movements, potentially limiting the role of early visual cortex in VWM storage.
