abstract: Understanding the common dimension of mental disorders (such as anxiety,
  depression, and drug addiction) might contribute to the construction of biological
  frameworks (Research Domain Criteria, RDoC) for novel ways of treatment. One common
  dimension at the behavioral level observed across these disorders is a generalization.
  Testing generalization in serotonin transporter (5-HTT) knockout (KO) rats, an animal
  model showing depression/anxiety-like behaviors and drug addiction-like behaviors,
  could therefore provide more insights into this framework. We tested the outcome
  and stimulus generalization in wild-type (WT) and 5-HTT KO rats. Using a newly established
  touchscreen-based task, subjects directly responded to visual stimuli (Gabor patch
  images). We measured the response time and outcome in a precise manner. We found
  that 5-HTT KO rats processed visual information faster than WT rats during outcome
  generalization. Interestingly, during stimulus generalization, WT rats gradually
  responded faster to the stimuli as the sessions progressed, while 5-HTT KO rats
  responded faster than WT in the initial sessions and did not change significantly
  as the sessions progressed. This observation suggests that KO rats, compared to
  WT rats, may be less able to update changes in information. Taken together, KO 5-HTT
  modulates information processing when the environment changes.
