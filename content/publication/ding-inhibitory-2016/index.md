abstract: With two cueing tasks, in the present study we examined output-based inhibitory
  cueing effects (ICEs) with manual responses to arrow targets following manual or
  saccadic responses to arrow cues. In all experiments, ICEs were observed when manual
  localization responses were required to both the cues and targets, but only when
  the cue–target onset asynchrony (CTOA) was 2,000 ms or longer. In contrast, when
  saccadic responses were made in response to the cues, ICEs were only observed with
  CTOAs of 2,000 ms or less—and only when an auditory cue-back signal was used. The
  present study also showed that the magnitude of ICEs following saccadic responses
  to arrow cues decreased with time, much like traditional inhibition-of-return effects.
  The magnitude of ICEs following manual responses to arrow cues, however, appeared
  later in time and had no sign of decreasing even 3 s after cue onset. These findings
  suggest that ICEs linked to skeletomotor activation do exist and that the ICEs evoked
  by oculomotor activation can carry over to the skeletomotor system.
