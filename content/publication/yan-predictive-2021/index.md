abstract: How does the brain maintain spatial attention despite the retinal displacement
  of objects by saccades? A possible solution is to use the vector of an upcoming
  saccade to compensate for the shift of objects on eye-centered (retinotopic) brain
  maps. In support of this hypothesis, previous studies have revealed attentional
  effects at the future retinal locus of an attended object, just before the onset
  of saccades. A critical yet unresolved theoretical issue is whether predictively
  remapped attentional effects would persist long enough on eye-centered brain maps,
  so no external input (goal, expectation, reward, memory, etc.) is needed to maintain
  spatial attention immediately following saccades. The present study examined this
  issue with inhibition of return (IOR), an attentional effect that reveals itself
  in both world-centered and eye-centered coordinates, and predictively remaps before
  saccades. In the first task, a saccade was introduced to a cueing task (“nonreturn-saccade
  task”) to show that IOR is coded in world-centered coordinates following saccades.
  In a second cueing task, two consecutive saccades were executed to trigger remapping
  and to dissociate the retinal locus relevant to remapping from the cued retinal
  locus (“return-saccade” task). IOR was observed at the remapped retinal locus 430-ms
  following the (first) saccade that triggered remapping. A third cueing task (“no-remapping”
  task) further revealed that the lingering IOR effect left by remapping was not confounded
  by the attention spillover. These results together show that predictive remapping
  leaves a robust attentional trace on eye-centered brain maps. This retinotopic trace
  is sufficient to sustain spatial attention for a few hundred milliseconds following
  saccades.
