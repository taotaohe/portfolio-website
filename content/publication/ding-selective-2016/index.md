abstract: Reading depends heavily on the efficient shift of attention. Mounting evidence
  has suggested that dyslexics have deficits in covert attentional shift. However,
  it remains unclear whether dyslexics also have deficits in overt attentional shift.
  With the majority of relevant studies carried out in alphabetic writing systems,
  it is also unknown whether the attentional deficits observed in dyslexics are restricted
  to a particular writing system. The present study examined inhibition of return
  (IOR)—a major driving force of attentional shifts—in dyslexic children learning
  to read a logographic script (i.e., Chinese). Robust IOR effects were observed in
  both covert and overt attentional tasks in two groups of typically developing children,
  who were age- or reading ability-matched to the dyslexic children. In contrast,
  the dyslexic children showed IOR in the overt but not in the covert attentional
  task. We conclude that covert attentional shift is selectively impaired in dyslexic
  children. This impairment is not restricted to alphabetic writing systems, and it
  could be a significant contributor to the difficulties encountered by children learning
  to read. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
