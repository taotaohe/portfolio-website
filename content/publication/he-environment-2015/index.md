abstract: Inhibition of return (IOR), typically explored in cueing paradigms, is a
  performance cost associated with previously attended locations and has been suggested
  as a crucial attentional mechanism that biases orientation towards novelty. In their
  seminal IOR paper, Posner and Cohen (1984) showed that IOR is coded in spatiotopic
  or environment-centered coordinates. Recent studies, however, have consistently
  reported IOR effects in both spatiotopic and retinotopic (eye-centered) coordinates.
  One overlooked methodological confound of all previous studies is that the spatial
  gradient of IOR is not considered when selecting the baseline for estimating IOR
  effects. This methodological issue makes it difficult to tell if the IOR effects
  reported in previous studies were coded in retinotopic or spatiotopic coordinates,
  or in both. The present study addresses this issue with the incorporation of no-cue
  trials to a modified cueing paradigm in which the cue and target are always intervened
  by a gaze-shift. The results revealed that a) IOR is indeed coded in both spatiotopic
  and retinotopic coordinates, and b) the methodology of previous work may have underestimated
  spatiotopic and retinotopic IOR effects.
